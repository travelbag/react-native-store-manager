    <h1>LittleKart — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>December - 2025</strong></p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Little-kart Ecommerce Private Limited</strong> ("we", "us" or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you use the LittleKart mobile application for store managers (the "App"). The App allows store managers to receive customer orders from the user-facing app, pick products, and assign deliveries to drivers.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following categories of information in order to provide and improve the App.</p>
    <h3>Personal information you provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account details:</strong> name, username, email address or phone number (if provided), and password. Passwords are stored securely (see "Security" below).</li>
      <li><strong>Profile data:</strong> store name, store location/address, contact phone number.</li>
      <li><strong>Order and product data:</strong> information about orders received through the user app such as order ID, products ordered, quantities, customer-provided notes, order status and timestamps.</li>
      <li><strong>Assignment data:</strong> which driver a particular order was assigned to and related assignment timestamps and status updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Automatically-collected information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> logs of when you open the App, features used, and other analytics data that helps us operate and improve the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Device information:</strong> device model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.</li>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> if you enable location features (for example, to report store location or help with assignments), we may collect approximate or precise device location. You can control location permissions in your device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Crash and diagnostic data:</strong> error reports that help us fix bugs and improve stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
    <p>We use collected data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the App (receive orders, manage inventory pickup, assign drivers).</li>
      <li>Authenticate and manage your account and provide customer support.</li>
      <li>Send important account and service-related messages (for example, order status updates or security alerts).</li>
      <li>Analyze usage patterns to improve the App and diagnose technical issues.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and protect the safety and security of users and our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal basis for processing (if applicable)</h2>
    <p>If you are located in a jurisdiction that requires a legal basis for processing personal data (for example, the EU), we rely on one or more of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Performance of a contract (to provide the App and related services).</li>
      <li>Compliance with legal obligations.</li>
      <li>Our legitimate interests (to operate, secure, and improve the App), except where overridden by your rights.</li>
      <li>Your consent, where required (for example, for certain marketing communications).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing your information</h2>
    <p>We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics, messaging, crash reporting). They are permitted to use your information only as necessary to provide those services to us.</li>
      <li><strong>Drivers & logistics partners:</strong> limited order and assignment details may be shared with drivers and delivery partners as needed to fulfill an order.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> if required by law, regulation, or a valid legal request (such as a court order), we may disclose information to comply.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, user information may be transferred. We will notify you of any material change in ownership and how it affects your information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the App, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and for internal business purposes such as analytics. When data is no longer required, we will securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect personal data against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. Passwords are stored using secure hashing and salting techniques. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Your choices and rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including the right to access, correct, update, port, restrict or object to processing, and request deletion. To exercise your rights, contact us using the details below. We will verify your identity before responding to certain requests.</p>

    <h2>8. Cookies, local storage & push notifications</h2>
    <p>The App may use local storage and cookie-like mechanisms to persist settings and session information. If the App uses push notifications, we may send messages related to orders, assignments, or account updates. You can disable push notifications in your device settings, but that may affect functionality.</p>

    <h2>9. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services (for analytics, crash reporting, messaging, maps). Those third parties have their own privacy policies and practices; please review them before using the App. We do not control those third parties and are not responsible for their privacy practices.</p>

    <h2>10. International data transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries other than your own. We will take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data as required by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>11. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for use by store managers and business representatives. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or higher age if required by local law). If you believe we have collected a child’s information, contact us and we will take steps to remove it.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will provide notice (for example, by updating the "Effective date" above and, where appropriate, notifying registered account holders).</p>
